### In this project, we're building an interactive dashboard to analyze the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which documents microbial species in human navels. The data shows that a few microbes are common across most individuals, while others are rare. This dashboard allows users to explore these findings dynamically, enhancing understanding and accessibility of microbial diversity across different demographics.

1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL
2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Display the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
