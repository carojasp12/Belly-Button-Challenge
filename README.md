# Belly-Button-Challenge

## In this project, we're building an interactive dashboard to analyze the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which documents microbial species in human navels. The data shows that a few microbes are common across most individuals, while others are rare. This dashboard allows users to explore these findings dynamically, enhancing understanding and accessibility of microbial diversity across different demographics.
