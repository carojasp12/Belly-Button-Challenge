# Belly-Button-Challenge

## In this project, we are developing an interactive dashboard to investigate the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which tracks microbial species, or operational taxonomic units (OTUs), found in human navels. The data reveals that a few species are common in over 70% of people, whereas most are rare. Our dashboard provides a dynamic visualization of these findings, allowing users to explore microbial diversity and prevalence across different populations. This tool enhances the accessibility of the dataset and promotes a deeper understanding of our microbiological companions.
